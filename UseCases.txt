Do you need efficiency?

	For I/O devices: when you have devices with low specs, memory restrictions, bandwith limitations. 
	
	For small, efficient and quick comunications.
	
	If you need to stream data.

	For microServices:
		If you need a near real time response, witch is faster than a message queue.


Cons:
	.proto files contract need to be keep in sync between client and server

Pro:
	grpc is a standar, with facilitates calls between different programing languages
